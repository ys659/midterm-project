# 📦 Project Setup

---

# 🧩 1. Install Homebrew (Mac Only)

> Skip this step if you're on Windows.

Homebrew is a package manager for macOS.  
You’ll use it to easily install Git, Python, Docker, etc.

**Install Homebrew:**

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

**Verify Homebrew:**

```bash
brew --version
```

If you see a version number, you're good to go.

---

# 🧩 2. Install and Configure Git

## Install Git

- **MacOS (using Homebrew)**

```bash
brew install git
```

- **Windows**

Download and install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).  
Accept the default options during installation.

**Verify Git:**

```bash
git --version
```

---

## Configure Git Globals

Set your name and email so Git tracks your commits properly:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
```

Confirm the settings:

```bash
git config --list
```

---

## Generate SSH Keys and Connect to GitHub

> Only do this once per machine.

1. Generate a new SSH key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

(Press Enter at all prompts.)

2. Start the SSH agent:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

3. Add the SSH private key to the agent:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

4. Copy your SSH public key:

- **Mac/Linux:**

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | pbcopy
```

- **Windows (Git Bash):**

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | clip
```

5. Add the key to your GitHub account:
   - Go to [GitHub SSH Settings](https://github.com/settings/keys)
   - Click **New SSH Key**, paste the key, save.

6. Test the connection:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

You should see a success message.

---

# 🧩 3. Clone the Repository

Now you can safely clone the course project:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

---

# 🛠️ 4. Install Python 3.10+

## Install Python

- **MacOS (Homebrew)**

```bash
brew install python
```

- **Windows**

Download and install [Python for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  
✅ Make sure you **check the box** `Add Python to PATH` during setup.

**Verify Python:**

```bash
python3 --version
```
or
```bash
python --version
```

---

## Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

(Optional but recommended)

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # Windows
```

### Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

# 🐳 5. (Optional) Docker Setup

> Skip if Docker isn't used in this module.

## Install Docker

- [Install Docker Desktop for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Install Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

## Build Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t <image-name> .
```

## Run Docker Container

```bash
docker run -it --rm <image-name>
```

---

# 🚀 6. Running the Project

- **Without Docker**:

```bash
python main.py
```

(or update this if the main script is different.)

- **With Docker**:

```bash
docker run -it --rm <image-name>
```

---

# 📝 7. Submission Instructions

After finishing your work:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Complete Module X"
git push origin main
```

Then submit the GitHub repository link as instructed.

# 🧮 Calculator Overview

This project builds an enhanced command-line calculator that supports a full range of arithmetic operations, history management, and automated testing.  
It applies design patterns like **Factory**, **Memento**, and **Observer** for clean architecture and scalability.

---

## ⚙️ Features Implemented

- Core operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide, power, root  
- Extended operations: modulus, integer division, percentage, absolute difference  
- Undo and redo functionality using the **Memento** pattern  
- Persistent calculation history with **auto-save** and **logging observers**  
- Configurable environment settings through `.env` variables  
- Robust error handling with custom exception classes  
- Unit tests with coverage above 90%  
- Continuous integration through **GitHub Actions**

---

## 🧩 Design and Structure

The codebase follows a modular layout with clear separation of concerns:

```
app/
├── calculator.py          # Core logic and REPL integration
├── operations.py          # All operation classes and Factory pattern
├── history.py             # History handling, observers, auto-save
├── calculator_memento.py  # Undo/redo implementation
├── calculator_config.py   # Loads environment variables
├── input_validators.py    # Validation utilities
├── exceptions.py          # Custom error types
└── logger.py              # Logging setup
```

Unit tests are organized under `tests/` and cover every major class and operation.

---

## 📈 Quality and Testing

- Code maintains high readability and consistency with OOP principles.  
- Comprehensive pytest suite validates functionality and error handling.  
- Coverage threshold meets or exceeds instructor requirements.  
- Logging and auto-save verified during execution.

---

## 🧠 Optional Enhancement

A color-coded output system using **Colorama** is planned as an optional feature to improve CLI readability and user experience.  

---

## 🏁 Summary

This project demonstrates a complete Python command-line application that integrates design patterns, CI/CD workflows, automated testing, and configuration management.  
It reflects strong software-engineering practices while keeping the interface simple and functional.
